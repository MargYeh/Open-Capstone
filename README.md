# Open-Capstone
This project is an ETL system that can be run autonomously using Azure Cloud architecture (Azure Blob Storage, Azure Databricks). It periodically collects data from the US Census API (American Community Survey 5-Year Data, 2009- 2022), cleans it, combines the new data with the old, and then uploads the finished products to Azure Blob as both Parquet files and CSV. To follow the process of development, go through the following directories in the order below:

- Project Proposal
- Data Exploration
- Data Collection
- Pipeline Prototype
- Prototype Scaling Pyspark
- Deployment Architecture Planning
- Code Testing
- Final Deployment
- Monitoring Dashboard
